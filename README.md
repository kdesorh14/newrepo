      <u><b>1. Giant Gas Cloud:</b></u>
A star originates from a large cloud of gas. The temperature in the gas cloud allow the synthesis of the key molecules that will birth a star.</p>
<p>
  2.<u><b>Protostar:</b></u>
When gas particles in the cloud collide, heat energy is produced. This results in the formation of a heated clump of molecules referred to as a Protostar. The creation of Protostars can be seen through infrared vision as the Protostars are warmer than other materials in the molecular cloud. Several Protostars can be formed in one cloud, depending on the size of the gas cloud it resides in.</p>
<p>
  3. <u><b>T-Tauri Phase:</u></b>
A T-Tauri star begins when materials stop falling into the Protostar and release tremendous amounts of energy. The mean temperature of the Tauri star isn’t enough to support nuclear fusion at its core. The T-Tauri star lasts for about 100 million years, following which it enters the most extended phase of development – the Main sequence phase.</p>
<p>
  4. <u><b>Main Sequence:</u></b>
The main sequence phase is the stage in development where the core temperature reaches the point for the fusion to commence. In this process, the protons of hydrogen are converted into atoms of helium. This reaction is exothermic; it gives off more heat than it requires and so the core of a main-sequence star releases a tremendous amount of energy.</p>
<p>
  5. <u><b>Red Giant:</u></b>
A star converts hydrogen atoms into helium over its course of life at its core. Eventually, the hydrogen fuel runs out, and the internal reaction stops. Without the reactions occurring at the core, a star contracts inward through gravity causing it to expand. As it expands, the star first becomes a subgiant star and then a red giant. Red giants have cooler surfaces than the main-sequence star, and because of this, they appear red than yellow.</p>
<p>
  6. <b><u>The Fusion of Heavier Elements:</b></u>
Helium molecules fuse at the core, as the star expands. The energy of this reaction prevents the core from collapsing. The core shrinks and begins fusing carbon, once the helium fusion ends. This process repeats until iron appears at the core. The iron fusion reaction absorbs energy, which causes the core to collapse. This implosion transforms massive stars into a supernova, while smaller stars like the sun contract into white dwarfs.</p>
<p>
  7. <b><u>Supernovae and Planetary Nebulae:</b></u>
Most of the star material is blasted away into space, but the core implodes into a neutron star or a singularity known as the black hole. Less massive stars don’t explode, their cores contract instead into a tiny, hot star known as the white dwarf while the outer material drifts away. Stars tinier than the sun, don’t have enough mass to burn with anything but a red glow during their main sequence. These red dwarves are difficult to spot. But, these may be the most common stars that can burn for trillions of years.</p>

<b>The above were the seven main stages of the life cycle of a star. Whether big or small, young or old, stars are one of the most beautiful and lyrical objects in all of creation. Next time you look up at the stars, remember, this is how they were created and how they will die.</b></p>
